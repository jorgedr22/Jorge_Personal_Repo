            To solely rely on something as new to us as A.I. would mean that lines of 
            code would dictate how we as humans would live life either for the better 
            or the worst. A.I. is trained to make the simplest task more simple to do, 
            therefore much quicker to accomplish. By allowing A.I. to be heavily involved 
            in our daily routines would increase productivity and allow for more time to 
            focus our attention on bigger and more significant issues. For example, 
            students rely on autocorrect, a form of A.I., for texting and writing essays 
            for a class. The reason for this question is to see if A.I. is, or will be, 
            at the point where humans can rely on it to do most things we consider an 
            inconvenience. A.I. is always learning and itâ€™s only a matter of time before
            a software developer creates an A.I. program that does chores, goes for groceries, 
            makes food all without the humans aspect of it. Though it may seem like an impossible 
            task for a couple of lines of code to do all of this, at this current moment, robots, 
            software, and all the necessary technology is accessible for any engineer to put all 
            these innovations together and create what was described.

            People have this idea of A.I., where eventually A.I. will dominate humans and 
            take over the world. Thats not necessary true, since a lot of research suggests that 
            A.I. can only go so far as we humans allow it to go. The fear of technology overthrowing
            human society is a genuine one for young adults that we brought in this generation of 
            technology.
