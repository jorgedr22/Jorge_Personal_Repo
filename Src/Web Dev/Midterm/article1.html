            Hybrid systems combining artificial and human intelligence hold great promise 
            for training human skills. In this paper, I position the concept of Hybrid Human-AI 
            Regulation and illustrate this with an example of a first prototype of a Hybrid Human-AI 
            Regulation (HHAIR) system. HHAIR supports self-regulated learning (SRL) in the context 
            of adaptive learning technologies (ALTs) with the aim to develop learners' self-regulated 
            learning skills. This prototype targets young learners (10–14 years) for whom SRL skills 
            are critical in today's society. Many of these learners use ALTs to learn mathematics and 
            languages every day in school. ALTs optimize learning based on learners' performance data, 
            but even the most sophisticated ALTs fail to support SRL. In fact, most ALTs take over (offload) 
            regulation from learners. In contrast, HHAIR positions hybrid regulation as a collaborative task 
            of the learner and the AI which is gradually transferred from AI-regulation to self-regulation. 
            Learners will increasingly regulate their own learning progressing through different degrees 
            of hybrid regulation. In this way HHAIR supports optimized learning and the transfer and development 
            of SRL skills for lifelong learning (future learning). The HHAIR concept is novel in proposing a 
            hybrid intelligence approach training human SRL skills with AI.

            When it comes to a hybrid approach to  A.I. and education a couple things should be considered:
            <ul>
                <li>Dont soley rely on A.I. to do the heavy lifting</li>
                <li>Focus on learning</li>
                <li>Use A.I. that isnt distracting</li>
                <li>Use A.I. for efficiency (auto grading/practice problems generation)</li>
            </ul>
