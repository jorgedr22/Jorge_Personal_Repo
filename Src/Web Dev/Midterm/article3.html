        <p class="article3_ab">
            There is a global interest in artificial intelligence to support online 
            learning, but little increase in support for online professors, teachers 
            and tutors (instructors). Over time, more students join online learning, 
            but instructors have no equivalent increase in support to manage their 
            online classes, leaving students under-served. This is evidenced by the 
            number of students who dropout or fail online courses, blaming the “lack 
            of support” from instructors. Interactions in such courses generate considerable 
            quantity and diversity of data, allowing the extraction of pedagogically 
            relevant information. However, instructors do not master the techniques and 
            technologies needed to do it, and it is not practical to train them to do so. 
            In this work, we propose an authoring tool (called T-Partner) that implements 
            a process we created to deal with educational data. The objective is to support 
            instructors making informed pedagogical decisions to manage their online course. 
            T-Partner promotes the cooperation between artificial and human intelligences, 
            owever we do not know the appropriate balance between these “intelligences”. 
            We then created two versions of the T-Partner to help instructors to: (1) find 
            relevant pedagogical situations occurring within their online courses; (2) understand 
            these situations; (3) create interventions (study plans, for example) to address 
            these situations; (4) monitor and evaluate the impact of these interventions. 
            We evaluated if both versions allowed instructors to make pedagogical decisions 
            and their perceptions regarding this support to decision-making. The results 
            show that both versions brought benefits to pedagogical decision-making, and 
            were positively perceived by the participants.
