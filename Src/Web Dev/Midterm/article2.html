        <p class="article2_ab">
            As artificial intelligence (AI) has become prevalent in users’ 
            daily lives, it is becoming critical for HCI designers to envision 
            and design future human-AI interactions. Recent studies have highlighted 
            the importance of exploring user-centered future design directions 
            before implementing a technology in users’ lives. However, it is 
            challenging for HCI designers to envision the societal impact of 
            future technology that does not exist and understand potential users’ 
            perceptions. Therefore, to comprehensively envision future human-AI 
            interactions and their impact and elicit potential users’ perceptions 
            of the future technologies, we created high-fidelity illustrations 
            with designers and illustrators for immersive experience. Subsequently, 
            through an online exhibition of these illustrations, we derived 
            potential users’ perceptions, expectations, and concerns about the 
            future. Based on our findings, we explored user-centered considerations 
            for implementing AI in users’ daily lives through elaborately articulated
            human-AI interactions.

                From the same study, another group of software developers and artists came together and generated this image of what they called "AI Cafe", where
                humans enslave AI to be lesser than humans since they were afraid of AI taking over society.

                Other artists and developers came up with the idea that A.I. will be simply used as a way to track the health
                of a person. The idea consisted of a symbiotic relation human and AI, where AI would be surgerically inserted
                to humans.
