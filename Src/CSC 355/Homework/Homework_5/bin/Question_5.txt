Advantages of Hashtables include fast retrieval of elements due to constant-time lookup, 
efficient insertion and deletion operations when properly implemented, and the flexibility of 
ey-value mapping for various applications. However, they are sensitive to collision resolution 
overhead, potentially consuming more memory than other data structures, and their performance
 heavily relies on the quality of the hash function chosen, which can affect efficiency.
