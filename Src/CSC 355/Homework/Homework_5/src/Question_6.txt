Advantages of Search Trees: Search trees offer efficient search 
operations with logarithmic time complexity, maintain elements in 
sorted order, facilitating range queries and ordered traversal, 
and support dynamic operations such as insertion, deletion, and 
modification of elements.

Disadvantages of Search Trees: Unbalanced trees can lead to 
degraded performance, requiring costly rebalancing operations, 
and they typically require additional memory overhead to maintain 
their structure and pointers.
